x: experimental crap
======

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/bits.chrsm.org/x?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/bits.chrsm.org/x)

x is a useless, unsupported, experimental dumping ground for random stuff.
Rather than creating new repositories for all of my random bits and bobs
and polluting my repository list, I'm just going to toss all the small
things here.

Available via `go get bits.chrsm.org/x/<whatever>`.
